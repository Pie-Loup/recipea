# recipea

* Get your Gemini API key here: https://aistudio.google.com
* Add it to .env file (create it if needed) in the recipea folder
* Install Docker on your machine
* Then run `docker-compose up --build`
It might take a bit more time on the first run while it installs all dependencies and download the model
